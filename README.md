    - How to become DevOps engineer?
        - Develop a mindset and start automating your daily jobs. Learn and master the tools used by DevOps engineer.
        - Github is used for code repository.
    - The application is working on my machine but it is not working on the client machine?
        - Because of the dependencies. Here we use docker to create images or build containers so that they work on different machines.
    - Need AWS or cloud services to manage it globally.
    - For scaling use Kubernetes
    - For continuous integration and deployment use Jenkins.
    - Use Terraform to automate the things.
    - Infrastructure is ready then use Ansible to deploy the code automatically.
