### **What is DevOps?**

- **DevOps** is a mechanism or a process which allows you fill the gap between Development team and Operations team, by rightly using automation, infrastructure, scaling, cloud platforms and so on.
    - It is a mindset or culture of automation and scalability.

- How to become DevOps engineer?
    - Develop a mindset and start automating your daily jobs. Learn and master the tools used by DevOps engineer.
    - Github is used for code repository.
- The application is working on my machine but it is not working on the client machine?
    - Because of the dependencies. Here we use docker to create images or build containers so that they work on different machines.
- Need AWS or cloud services to manage it globally.
- For scaling use Kubernetes
- For continuous integration and deployment use Jenkins.
- Use Terraform to automate the things.
- Infrastructure is ready then use Ansible to deploy the code automatically.
- As a DevOps engineer, having a strong understanding of networking is essential forseveral reasons:
    - **Infrastructure Design:** One of the core responsibilities of a DevOps engineer is to design and implement infrastructure that supports software development and deployment. This includes setting up networks, configuring routers and firewalls, and ensuring that servers and other devices are properly connected. Understanding networking protocols and infrastructure design principles is essential for designing an efficient and scalable infrastructure.
    - **Application Deployment:** DevOps engineers are responsible for deploying applications to production environments. This involves setting up and configuring servers, load balancers, and other network components to ensure that the application runs smoothly and reliably. Understanding networking principles is essential for configuring network components and resolving network-related issues that may arise during application deployment.
    - **Automation:** DevOps is all about automating processes to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Networking automation tools, such as Ansible and Puppet, are used to automate the configuration of network devices and ensure that they are properly configured and maintained. A good understanding of networking protocols and automation tools is essential for automating network-related tasks.
    - **Monitoring:** DevOps engineers are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the infrastructure and applications they manage. This includes monitoring network traffic, identifying bottlenecks and performance issues, and troubleshooting network-related problems. Understanding networking protocols and tools is essential for identifying and resolving network issues
    in a timely manner.
